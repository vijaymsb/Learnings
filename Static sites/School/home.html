                <h1>Our Curriculum</h1>
                <p>Pedagogy needs to evolve to keep pace with the changing needs of the 21stcentury. Pedagogy in India was shaped by the needs of the colonial powers and chiefly required recall of facts. Curricula were created to reflect that need. Pedagogy today requires the teacher to encourage students to create and communicate, reflect on, synthesise and apply knowledge. The NCERT has done significant work in this respect, However, no single curriculum has all the features that we require; hence we created our own, student centric curriculum that supports our education vision.
