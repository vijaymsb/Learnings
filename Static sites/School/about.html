        <h2>What Parent Say About GVK ?</h2>
        <div class="parents">
            <p>After visiting many schools in this area, I decided on GVK school due to a right mix of academic and extra curricular facilities and passion of school leadership towards education and holistic development of a child. I also liked the school campus which is based in a traffic free environment friendly zone. My daughter is in LKG and i have seen great progress in her in term of her communication skills. I look forward to seeing the great path of progress which the school has embarked on. </p>
